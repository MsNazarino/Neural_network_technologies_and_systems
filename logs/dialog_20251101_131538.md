Okay, the user is asking for advice on how to deal with anxiety. Let me start by acknowledging their feelings and validating that it's common. I should mention that anxiety is a natural response but can be managed.

First, I need to outline practical steps they can take. Maybe start with recognizing when anxiety starts, as that's important for understanding the triggers. Then suggest grounding techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness. 

I should also include lifestyle changes—like exercise, sleep, and diet. It's crucial to mention seeking professional help if it's severe. Oh, and maybe some specific strategies like journaling or setting small goals
