Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Ukraine. Let me think. I know that Ukraine's capital is Kyiv. But wait, I should double-check to make sure. Sometimes there might be confusion with other cities. For example, some people might confuse it with Kharkiv or Odessa. But no, Kyiv is definitely the capital. It's a major city in the east, and it's the political, cultural, and economic center of Ukraine. I should confirm that there's no other capital, but I remember from history that after the Soviet era, Kyiv was the capital again. Yeah, so the answer is Kyiv.

Столиця України — це **Києв**. Що бажаєш з ним поговорити?
